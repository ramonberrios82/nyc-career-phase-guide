#DevConnect Overview

##What is DevConnect?
Dev Bootcamp’s Employer Partner Network of over 450 companies on [DevConnect](https://connect.devbootcamp.com/), a platform that allows you to search through our network of partner companies based on various queries (company size, location, hiring status, etc.) and introduce yourself directly to the hiring manager or recruiter at the company.

By creating a profile using your Launchpad login credentials, you gain access to our entire employer network (SF, Chicago, NY) and can discover which companies interest you and are actively hiring and send introduction straight to the inbox of the employee who will help you navigate the application/interview process.

##Student Profile Overview
Get started by heading to [https://connect.devbootcamp.com/](https://connect.devbootcamp.com/). Login with your Launchpad credentials and you’ll be taken directly to your DevConnect profile page. Your profile (photo and personal information) will be imported from Launchpad.

From here, you can edit...

Pull experiences from your Linkedin profile, but don’t copy and paste or use bullets. Tell a story!

###List of things to learn
Employers want to know that you’re always looking to learn, exploring new languages and technologies, and building your skillset.

###Languages/Frameworks/Technologies

###Notables
Anything you want employers to know about you (were you the team lead on your final project)

##Companies
All the companies that you see listed in DevConnect are part of Dev Bootcamp’s employer network. They know who we are and what we do here and are interested in hiring Dev Bootcamp grads!

Companies cannot see you or your profile until you introduce yourself to them, so polish off your profile and start making intros to companies that interest you!

###Search fields
* First, search by companies that are “hiring now”
* Second, search by the location that you would like to work in (search by San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sunnyvale, Mt. View, etc. so you don’t miss any!)

##Introductions
Each student is initially given 3 intros. Please use them!

This <b>does not</b> mean you are limited to 3 intros. We want you to be both strategic and successful in your job search. If you’re not hearing back from companies or are hearing that they are not interested at this time, your intro will be replaced. A company is given 7 days to respond to an intro, either by writing you back or selecting “not interested”

###How to use an intro
On the profile of a company that you’re interested in working at, select “Request Introduction.” A pre-populated introduction email will appear, and you’ll need to click the “send” button.

###Please note:
* All the initial intro emails employers get are identical. Send a personal message (similar to a cover letter email) right away if you’re excited about a role/company and tell them just that and more!
* If you don’t hear back within 48 hours, reply with a personal message to the hiring manager. Tell them why you’re interested in their company and this role
* If you don’t hear back within 7 days, DevConnect will automatically replace any intro that wasn’t fruitful
